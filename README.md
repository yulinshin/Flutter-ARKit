## Add the ARKit plugin

ARKit is the best plugin for iOS device, and I don't recommend you use the ar_flutter_plugin, which have a complicated configuration process. [Here](https://pub.dev/packages/arkit_plugin) is the tutorial to set up.

## Xcode configuration

Make sure uncomment the 'platform :ios, '9.0' in the iOS/podfile and replace the '9.0' with '13.0'

## Run

Run with 'Flutter run --release'
